# MedInsuranceProject
For this project, I used my current skills in Python and the CSV library to analyze data from a .csv file which contained data about individuals that have a medical insurance and the characteristics that determine their bills. This project was made with some of the Codecademy resources 

I am getting pretty excited with these kind of projects, since I'm new to doing my own personal ones (with some help in this case). Feel free to give me any feedback, I am eager to learn and know what else could I do to improve the quality of my projects.
